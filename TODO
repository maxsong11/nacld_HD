 - missing features:
     - stop playing a stream if the sender stops sharing. Restart if needed.
     - fix crash when joining an existing session
     - check if it's possible to reduce initial hang at start
         - is it caused by too many resend requests?
     - performance:
         - check if old nacks are being freed
         - check how many times the same packet is being requested
         - check how many times the same packet is being sent
         - check number of lost packets (and number of peers who lost it)
         - check if better performance can be achieved by changing some
           constants:
             - playout_delay_ms
             - number of frames/packets sent per burst
         - add capture resolution as a parameter to the JS interface
 - refactory:
     - merge UDPListener and UdpTransport
     - move rtcp packet out of rtp.h
     - remove shared pointers (most of they are possibly not necessary)
     - change build so debug mode automatically enables debug messages
   - move decoder/player code out of main.cc
   - encrypt/decrypt transmitted content
   - audio encoding/decoding
   - Correctly set send_buffer_size
 - extra:
     - support IPv6
